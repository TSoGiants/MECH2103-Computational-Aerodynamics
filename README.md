# MECH2103-Computational-Aerodynamics
Kepler short-course on numerical simulation of rockets and other aerodynamic systems.

Development of this course is underway; you can follow our progress alternative Friday mornings at 9am CDT at www.tsog.tv. Next stream is 9/6/19.

The focus of this course is to teach students the fundamentals of numerical simulation for aerodynamic systems. The scope of the course will encompass numerical techniques such as RK4, an introduction to computational fluid dynamics, and simulation of a rocket's trajectory.

### Notes from first Standing Meeting (8/23/19):
Tentative outline:

1.	Eulerâ€™s method review / RK1-4 explanation. Parabolic trajectory simulation.
2.	Fluid dynamics / CFD (wind tunnel video would be great, water dye test for boat hulls). Wind tunnel setup and testing / etc.
3.	Paper airplane toss (lift, drag, angle of attack)
4.	Stability (center of pressure / center of mass)
5. TBD
6. TBD
7. TBD
8. Rocket simulation

Action items:
