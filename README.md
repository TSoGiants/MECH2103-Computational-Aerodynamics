# MECH2103-Computational-Aerodynamics
Kepler short-course on numerical simulation of rockets and other aerodynamic systems.

Development of this course is underway; you can follow our progress alternating Friday mornings at 9am CDT at www.tsog.tv. Next stream is 9/20/19.

The focus of this course is to teach students the fundamentals of numerical simulation for aerodynamic systems. The scope of the course will encompass numerical techniques such as RK4, an introduction to computational fluid dynamics, and simulation of a rocket's trajectory.

### Notes from first Standing Meeting (8/23/19):
Tentative outline:

1.	Eulerâ€™s method review / RK1-4 explanation. Parabolic trajectory simulation.
2.	Fluid dynamics / CFD (wind tunnel video would be great, water dye test for boat hulls). Wind tunnel setup and testing / etc.
3.	Paper airplane toss (lift, drag, angle of attack)
4.	Stability (center of pressure / center of mass)
5. TBD
6. TBD
7. TBD
8. Rocket simulation

**Action items:**

Mr. Maldonado - Draft week 1 worksheet.

### Notes from Standing Meeting (9/6/19):
Discussed and demonstrated CFD tool Sim-Flow. Tutorial (https://help.sim-flow.com/userguide/wing/) covers basic simulation of an airfoil with flaps. Noted that the tutorial is very barebones and doesn't cover much background information about aerodynamics or FEM simulation in general.

Discussed the flow of the course. Will most likely aim to have students complete two seperate mini-projects: one focused on an airplane, the other on a rocket. This will cover two different sides of aerospace engineering while leaving room for sufficient theory.

**Action items:**

Dr. F - Write up lesson 1 curriculum for setting up Euler's / RK4 simulation of projectile motion.

Mr. Maldonado - Write up detailed tutorial based on the Sim-Flow wing tutorial, but more in-depth. Add follow-up simulation calculating drag of a ball and incorporate results into RK4 simulation.
